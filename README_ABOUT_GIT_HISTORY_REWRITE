This git repo does not contain the original DVIDSparkServices git history!

What happened here?

Why don't the commit SHA values in this repo match the ones in the
  main DVIDSparkServices repo?

And where are all the test input data files?

I deleted them.  The 'flyemflows' repo is based on an older
project named DVIDSparkServices.  Despite the significant break
with the old project, I wanted to preserve the git history of
the old project. However, the old project made the unfortunate
decision to include large binary files in its git repo.
Definitely a no-no.

Due to that unnecessary weight, I considered simply starting a
brand new git repo from scratch when I started the flyemflows project.
But that would lose the git history altogether. Instead, I rewrote the git
history entirely, and dropped all the binary test input files.

This means you won't be able to check out an old commit and run the integration tests.
(If you're really interested in that, find the original DVIDSparkServices repo.)
But at least you can see the full git commit history for the source code.
